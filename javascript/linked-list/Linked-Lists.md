## Approach & Efficiency

- Big O for Append is O(n) and space O(1) 
- Big O for Insert is O(1) and space O(1) 
- Big O for Includes is O(n) and space O(1)

## API

- insert : To Insert a new Node To The Head of Linked List.

- includes : To Check if a Value send exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.
